            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>It all started when I was 16, sitting at my desk, running my first "Hello, World!" program. At the time,
                I didn't realize that a few lines of code would ignite a passion that would shape my future. What
                started as curiosity soon became an obsession—I found myself fascinated by how software could solve
                real-world problems and bring ideas to life. Now, as a third-year Software Engineering student at the
                University of Guelph, I've been honing my skills in Python, JavaScript, and Mobile Computing, gaining
                hands-on experience in designing and developing scalable applications. Whether it's optimizing database
                queries and working on python servers for my Billiards game project or implementing graphs in R for my
                Basketball Calculator, I thrive on tackling complex challenges that push me to think critically and
                innovate. But beyond the technical side, what truly excites me is building software that makes a real
                impact—creating solutions that are not just efficient but also intuitive and user-friendly. Every
                project, every bug fixed, and every new concept learned is a step forward in this journey, and I can't
                wait to see where it leads next.

            <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My projects like the Basketball Calculator and Economic Resilience Tracker reflect three core principles:
            </p>

            <ul class="philosophy-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> Every feature begins with "How will this help the end-user?"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Building components that can evolve independently
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance First:</strong> Optimizing algorithms before scaling infrastructure
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This methodology helped me reduce API response times by 40% in my Billiards game and implement real-time
                data processing for the Hamilton/Toronto economic tracker.</p>
